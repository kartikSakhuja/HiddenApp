Summary

I have created a simple app which initially loads in background and on click of volume button 3 times it moves to the foreground stage and vice-versa.

Contents 

MainActivity.kt
MainActivity2.kt
NewService.kt

Usage 

This app can be simply tested by clicking on the app icon and then pressing volume button 3 times to launch the main screen and then, again pressing 3 times to come back 
to background (initial) stage again.
